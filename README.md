A terminal UI for managing multiple AI coding sessions across git worktrees, with integrated GitHub and Azure DevOps pull request tracking.

## Features

- **Session management** — create, kill, and delete worktree-based AI coding sessions from a single TUI
- **PR tracking** — view open, draft, and merged pull requests alongside your active sessions
- **Code reviews tab** — see PRs where you're a reviewer, grouped by status (needs review, waiting for author, approved)
- **Branch sync** — automatic merge detection, conflict counting, auto-delete of merged branches, one-key rebase
- **Terminal integration** — full ANSI passthrough and input forwarding to tmux sessions
- **Configurable AI tool** — switch between Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, or a custom command
- **Settings panel** — auto-detect VCS provider, configure sync intervals, and set project preferences

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- tmux
- git
- `gh` CLI (for GitHub provider)

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install
npx nx serve cli
```

Pass a target directory to manage a different project:

```sh

```
